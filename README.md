Helps you to control hacked portals during [Aurora Glyph Hack Challenge](https://community.ingress.com/en/discussion/3187/aurora-glyph-hack-challenge). It allows you to manually mark hacked portals. Use the 'highlighter-aurora' plugin to show the hacked portals on the map, and 'sync' to share between multiple browsers or desktop/mobile.

* Open the [raw version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrDinckleman/iitc-plugins/master/aurora.user.js) of the plugin and install it.
* Refresh Ingress Intel map.
* Select the "Aurora" highlighter, all portals will be marked as red.
* Open the portal information and check the boxes corresponding to the glyph sequences that you successfully hacked.
* Portal color will be changed from red to green depending on the number of sequences.
